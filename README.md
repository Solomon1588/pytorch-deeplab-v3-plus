# [WIP] DeepLab V3+ PyTorch
DeepLab V3+ is a state-of-the-art model for semantic segmentation. This repository contains a pytorch implementation of DeepLab V3+ finetuned for driving scene segmentation tasks (eg: BDD100k).

## TODO
- Upload pretrained model and results on BDD100k
- Add support for mixed-precision training
- Add support for MobileNet
- Pretrain backend on ImageNet / MS-COCO
