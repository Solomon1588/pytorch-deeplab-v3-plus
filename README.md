# [WIP] DeepLab V3+ PyTorch

This is a pytorch implementation of DeepLab V3+, optimized for semantic segmentation on driving-datasets like Berkeley's Deepdrive dataset.

## TODO
- Upload pretrained model and results on BDD100k
- Add support for mixed-precision training
- Add support for MobileNet
- Pretrain backend on ImageNet / MS-COCO
